1. Run the python script to get the odb and stress along three paths (top, bottom and center) of a platelet.
2. The excel file used for plotting the FE results takes the average of the stresses obtained for three paths, normalized with the average stress of the
composite
3. To get the average stress in the composite, total RF1 is divided by the width of the platelet.
